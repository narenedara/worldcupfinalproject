            <h1 class="Header">What is the World Cup</h1>
            <p1>The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match,
             a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The World Cup, the most prestigious soccer tournament in the world ,is played every four years. This schedule allows time for the qualification tournaments and play-offs to take place, for the 32 national teams to play off in the month-long tournament.The four-year gap between each World Cup tournament allows time for the qualification fixtures to be played. While many of us would love to see the World Cup happen every year, I’m sure we can all agree it’s too big of an event and too special to be rushed! 
            The World Cup has been played every 4 years since its inaugural tournament in Uruguay in 1930, and played every 4 years since, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of World War II.
            In 2018, for the first time in the history of the World Cup, all 211 member nations entered the qualification process for the World Cup. With Russia automatically qualifying as the host country, the remaining 210 nations competed for the remaining 31 places during 872 matches.</p1>

            <h1 class="Header">Who's in?</h1>
            <p1>For the first time ever, teams from all six populated continents are represented in the knockout stage, including two teams from Africa and two teams from Asia. No team from outside Europe or South America has ever played in a World Cup final. This year, six teams hope to break that streak.A total of 832 players, more than ever before, will spend the next few nights dreaming of what the next few weeks might bring.
            Many of them have legitimate reason to hope: This year’s field is, perhaps, a little more open than usual, with the major European powers that have dominated for two decades threatened by Brazilian and Argentine revivals and menaced by a strong contingent from Africa. It is too soon, of course, to know how it will go, but it is possible to get some sense of what Qatar 2022 will look like.</p1>
